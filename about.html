                <br></br>
                <p>Hi, I'm Nicolina Feldt!
                    <br></br>

                    Currently a UX-design student in Gothenburg.
                    <br></br>
                    After working full-time for five years as a car assembler at Volvo, I <br>decided to study Java
                    development. Halfway through, I realized that<br> programming wasn't my jam and that UX design
                    sounded
                    way more <br>exciting and a better fit for me, so I decided to jump on that train<br> instead. But
                    by
                    studying programming for a year I learned how to see<br> things from a programmer's point of view. I
                    am
                    currently learning how <br>to use my curiosity to talk to people, create innovative, human-centered
                    design solutions, and get comfortable while being<br> uncomfortable.
                    <br></br>
                    I've always been interested in technology since it's a fast-moving<br> industry with endless
                    possibilities and psychology, and combining the<br> two is very interesting. I am learning to
                    connect
                    with people,<br> understand their pain points and problems, and then develop a<br> solution to fix
                    them.
                </p>
