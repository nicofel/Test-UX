            <h3>THE CASE</h3>
            <br>
            <p>We continued using the mock-up company Elbolaget AB. They wanted to see how their customers
                interacted with their website so that they could see if they had to make improvements and make their
                website easier for users. We chose Maja as she is a student with a tight budget and wants to keep
                track of her electricity usage so she can use her money on more fun things.</p><br>
            <br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h3>WHO IS THE CUSTOMER JOURNEY BASED ON?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The customer journey we created was based on the persona of Maja Persson, 24, who is a law student at
            Uppsala University. She's keen to make sure she has enough money since she is a student and wants to
            avoid unnecessary costs. Maja currently lives in a 40-square-meter student apartment with her partner,
            with who she often consults when making important decisions.<br>
            <br>
            Life as a student is hectic, so there is no time to focus on electricity consumption or contracts. Maja
            would rather spend time on all the fun activities student life offers. To quickly get an overview of her
            costs, Maja prefers to use her mobile phone and finds it frustrating if there are too many steps in the
            process. High electricity prices are one thing that worries Maja in her everyday life.</p>

            <h3>INTERVIEW</h3>
            <br>
            <p>We found positive and negative aspects that arose during the user's interaction with Elbolaget AB
                through a qualitative interview and user tests.<br>
                <br>
                The interview was conducted remotely based on prepared questions with the possibility of
                follow-up questions and in-depth discussions. During the interview, we found out that Maja's
                goal was to get a better overview of her finances; hence her main priority was the cost of
                electricity contracts.<br>
                <br>
                She had been in touch with customer service on a few occasions when there had been a power cut
                to find out how long it would take for the power to come back. She said that the customer
                service employee was very accommodating and friendly.<br>
                <br>
                During the interview, it became clear that Maja had no previous knowledge of Elbolaget AB and
                first came in contact with the company through the Elskling tool, which she used to find,
                compare, and sign a new contract when she first moved into her apartment.</p>

                <h3>TESTING</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Maja thought it was a bit tedious that there was not a ready-made app for Elbolaget AB, she felt
                    that it would improve the experience of the service. The answers from the interview gave a good
                    understanding of why the user chose Elbolaget AB.<br>
                    <br>
                    Based on the interview, we were able to find several touchpoints where the user interacted with
                    the company. The first customer journey is mainly based on interview data.<br>
                    <br>
                    We found out how the user became a customer, why she applied to Elbolaget AB, and how she felt.
                    Maja had to share her screen and show how she maneuvered through the website.<br>
                    <br>
                    During the test, she was also asked to continuously tell us how she was thinking when using the
                    service, and whether it was easy or challenging to achieve the goal.<br>
                    <br>
                    All tests were conducted on mobile as this is what Maja used the most. We decided to test the
                    mobile version because Maja is a person who uses her phone a lot and always has it with her. So
                    we felt that a good mobile version was important to focus on.</p>

<!--                 Text som förklarar varför customer jounrey och vad jag har lärt mig
 -->                <h3>WHY ARE CUSTOMER JOURNEYS IMPORTANT?</h3>
                <br>
                <p>It is a strategic approach to understanding customer expectations and is important to optimize
                    the customer experience. It is as essential for a small and medium-sized company as for a larger
                    company. Mapping out the journey has a lot of benefits like:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Benchmarking the customer experience desired by the customers against what they actually
                        receive.</li>
                        <br>
                    <li>Understanding the differences in buyer personas as they move from prospect to conversion
                        through
                        the buying funnel.</li>
                        <br>
                    <li>Creating a logical order to your buyer journey</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p>The most significant benefit is simply understanding the customers more. The better you know
                    their expectations, the more you tailor the customer experience to their needs.</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <h3>WHAT DID I LEARN?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>I got some more insight on how to conduct an interview with general questions and more in-depth
                questions. I also got to observe a user test where the persona had to try out the website.<br>
                <br>
                I also learned how to write a customer journey and how important they are. It is a good tool to see
                how the customers experience a website and to see if it needs improvements.</p>
